      COMPONENT DEFINITIONS:

      Define four types of sliders:

      - ID 1: active range slider that operates on arbitrary range (range boundaries defined by
        the associated sensor) and allows thumb to be used to set a new value

      - ID 2: passive range slider that displays value from its sensor (within the sensor's range)
        but does not allow user to modify (set new values) using the slider thumb

      - ID 3: level slider on range [0-100], otherwise same as ID 1

      - ID 4: passive level slider that behaves like ID3 but does not allow user to modify
        values using thumb
