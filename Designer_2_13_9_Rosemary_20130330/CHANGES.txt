   which allows reuse of images across multiple UI components and 
   screens.

   tree were not shown correctly (MODELER-262, MODELER-281)
 - Multiple elements in the UI designer can be selected

   operations
 - Selected elements can be moved with arrow keys instead

Designer 2.11.3 (2012-03-25 Formosa)
====================================

Bug fix release.

 - Export all commands even if not referenced from buttons or sensors.

 - Domain model from previous Designer version's serialized state
   may reference image objects that are no longer present in the
   saved state (stale references). Mark these as errors and then
   ignore the references instead of causing a permanent save error
   alert.


Designer 2.11.2 (2012-03-13 Formosa)
====================================

Bug fix release.

 - New accounts may save (empty) controller and panel document instances
   despite there not being serialized Designer state. The lack of serialization
   data should not be flagged as an error in Designer.

 - Certain image sources still include partial file paths. Unclear if this is
   caused by pre-existing serialization data generated by previous Designer
   versions or if there's stil incorrect API use to include paths in image
   source names in current revision. Temporary stop-gap fix included to strip
   the erroneous paths.
